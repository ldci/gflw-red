## http://www.red-lang.org/ http://www.glfw.org/

This binding has been extensively tested with Mac OSX 10.9.1 and works fine under OSX. 
Please adapt path to libraries according your main OS.
This version can be used with the last glfw version 3.0.4.

### glfw.reds

### opgl.reds 

A  quick done binding to OpenGL to be used with Red since GLFW requires OpenGL.
